                    In a third world country like Bangladesh,agriculture is one ofthe largest sector. About 50 %of the
                    population are employed in this sector and about 70 %people overall depend on agriculture for their
                    livelihood.The average share of agriculture as a proportion of GDPis 29.65%as of 2019.(Imdad,
                    2021)According to the World Bank, the total arable land in Bangladesh is 61.2 percent of the total
                    land
                    area. (Nations Encyclopedia)Despite these statistics,it is a matter of sorrow that the Backbone of
                    this
                    sector, the farmers are not getting their fair share of the part as different types of middlemenare
                    engaging in their trade. For this reason,farmersare being underpaid and losing their interest in
                    farming, which may lead to an economical breakdown.Our solution to this problem is Krishok Bangla
                    which
                    is an Agricultural Management System. It is a digital B2B market solution which will help farmers
                    and
                    dealers to connect with each other and allow the dealers to buy crops and vegetables from farmers
                    all
                    over Bangladesh. This agricultural management system will work as a bridge between farmers and
                    dealers
                    and would decrease many hassles of traditional crop buying methods and would increase profitability
                    and
                    efficiency for both farmers and the dealers.</br></br>
